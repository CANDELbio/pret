**What kind of data does this impact?**

E.g. clinical observations, assay types, patient/subject information, samples, etc.

**What specifically can't be expressed in the current schema?**

I.e. "I can't code this RECIST field at all (missing enum)", or "I can't put in multiple proteins per epitopes," or "the coding used for this doesn't match the clinical standard for reporting X."

**Which people or what documentation is authoritative?**

When relevant, refer to any relevant clinical standards, ontologies, external resources, etc. and identify experts at PICI or partners who can help us ensure we're representating the data correctly.
